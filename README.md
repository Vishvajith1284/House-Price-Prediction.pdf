# AI_Phase_1_To_5 : 

1. Data Collection :
   - Start by collecting a large dataset that contains information about houses.
   - This data can come from various sources, such as real estate listings, public records, or online databases.
   - It should include details about each house, like its size, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other relevant features.

2. Data Cleaning :
   - Once you have your dataset, you need to clean it. T
   - his means checking for any errors, missing values, or inconsistencies in the data.
   - For instance, if some houses have missing information about the number of bathrooms, you need to decide how to handle those missing values.

3. Data Exploration :
   - Explore the dataset to understand the relationships between different features and house prices.
   - You can create visualizations, like scatter plots or histograms, to get insights into the data.
   - This exploration helps you identify which features are likely to be good predictors of house prices.

4. Feature Selection :
   - Choose the most relevant features for your prediction model.
   - Some features may have a stronger influence on house prices, so focus on those.
   - You can also create new features based on domain knowledge. For example, you might calculate the price per square foot or proximity to amenities.

5. Data Splitting :
   - Divide your dataset into two parts: a training set and a testing set.
   - The training set is used to teach your machine learning model, and the testing set is used to evaluate how well it can predict house prices.

6. Model Selection :
   - Choose a regression algorithm.
   - Linear Regression is a common choice, but you can also consider more complex models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting.
   - Each model has its strengths and weaknesses.

7. Model Training :
   - Train your selected model using the training data.
   - The model learns the relationships between the chosen features and the actual house prices.

8. Model Evaluation :
   - Use the testing data to assess the model's performance. Common evaluation metrics include:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices.
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual prices.
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE, giving you a more interpretable metric.
   - R-squared (RÂ²): Indicates how well the model fits the data, with higher values indicating a better fit.

9. Hyperparameter Tuning :
   - Fine-tune the model by adjusting its hyperparameters.
   - These are settings that control the model's behavior, like learning rate or tree depth.
   - You can use techniques like grid search or cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters.
10. Deployment :
    - Once you're satisfied with your model's performance, you can deploy it in a real-world application.
    - It can now be used to make predictions on new, unseen houses to estimate their prices.

11. Continuous Monitoring and Maintenance:
    - Keep your model up to date.
    - House prices can change over time due to market fluctuations, so you should periodically retrain your model to ensure it remains accurate.
